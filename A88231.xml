         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

out my heart according to my weake talent, to bend my braines to the ſtudy of
ſomething that might be for the effectually future good of yours, (to whom
<hi>I</hi> have ſo many indeared obligations,) and all the reſt of your

neceſſitated to acquaint you, that <hi>J</hi> have not a little been

            <p>
               <hi>WOrthy Gentlemen and deare Friends.</hi> The fervency of your
love to me, and your endeavours for my freedome, by petitioning the Parliament,
hath taken ſuch deep impreſſion upon my heart that I cannot but often
renew my thankfull acknowledgement, and ſtudy to ſerve you in particular,
while <hi>I</hi> endeavour to ſerve my whole Country in Generall. And truly
the beſt ſervice that <hi>I</hi> can doe you in this iuncture of time, in
my opinion is to ſtudy your peace: For if the red Horſe of Warre ſhould
againe enter into our gates, the paile Horſe of famine will certainly tread
upon his heeles, and then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be expected but deſolation, now the
only effectuall meanes to eſtabliſh your peace, is the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of
diveſions, and that only can be effected by uniting in the common principles
of freedome and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and for that end is <hi>the Petition which</hi> I
<hi>have</hi> ſent you framed, certainly if all the people did but heare the
freedome which we petition for opened. And if you did informe them, that
thoſe you account the price of your blood, and that you ſhould never

ſecure to them.</p>
            <p>O my friends, that God would give you light and power, to ſee
and endeavour after the things which belong to your peace and freedome, before
they be bid from your eyes, there is now an opportunity and if this be
neglected, <hi>I</hi> feare God will not betruſt us with another, and in
reaſon if we doe not act ſpeedily and vigoruſly, it will be
impoſſible to prevent Warre and confuſion. Now in your actings in this
buſineſſe, <hi>I</hi> deſire if my advice might be of any weight with
you.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that in ſuch places as you cannot gaine liberty to have
the Petition read on the firſt day in the week in the meeting houſe, there
deſire as great a meeting of the people ſome other day as you can get, and
read the Petition, and explain it, and then ſelect ſome active men as
Truſtees, to take care for gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſubſcriptions. <hi>2.</hi> Engage as
many perſons as poſſible you can, to come to <hi>London</hi> with the
Petition, and to cry reſolutely to the Parliament, <hi>Iuſtice,

your information, bought by a publique ſtock, which you ſhould be truſt

whoſe oath you may at large read in the 10. page following, read alſo that

this, but eſpecially read the marginall notes in the 69. page following and

take a penny from) the meaneſt man in England, without common conſent in
Parliament and if the King &amp;c. the greater cannot doe it, then undeniably
the Iudges or juſtices the leſſer can much leſſe doe it. And
beſides by the ſame right, that under pretence of dues or fees by their
arbitrary wills and pleaſures, they take one farthing from you or me, they
may take a penny, yea a ſhilling, ye a pound, yea a thouſand pound, and

                  <pb facs="tcp:115109:6"/>For upon the 19. of <hi>Ian.</hi> laſt, the

treaſonable and ſeditious practiſes againſt the ſtate.</hi> And unto
the power of the Houſe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting me J ſtooped, but at their doore
deſired to be committed by a legall Warrant, which by their own Law
(publiſhed in Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> inſtitutes) Votes, and Ordinances,
all warrants of commitments whatſoever ought expreſly to containe the
certaine particular caſe, wherefore a man is committed, and ought to
conclude, and him ſafely to keep till he be delivered by due courſe of Law,
and for the full proof of this, read the 68, 69. pages of the following
diſcourſe, and the 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, pages of Mr. <hi>Iohn Wildmans</hi>
late defence, called Truths Triumph, or Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery anotamiſed.</p>
               <p>But if the Warrant be in generall words, and be alſo to keep
him during their pleaſure, and made by the Parliament, the priſoner is
murthered and deſtroyed by ſuch an impriſonment. For he muſt either
ſtoop to their wills, and ſo betray his liberties and ſin againſt his

before any Iudge in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> will grant him a <hi>Habeas
Corpus</hi> to bring him up to the barre of Juſtice, either to receive his
puniſhment according to Law, or elſe his liberties as uniuſtly
impriſoned, and this made me the other day at the Houſe of Commons, to
conteſt for a legal warrant, before I would go to Priſon; but that
mercinary Turkiſh Ianiſary, Col. <hi>Baxſter</hi> laid violent hands upon
me, telling me expreſly he was not either to reaſon or diſpute the
Houſes commands, but to obey them; &amp; cauſed his Soldiers to draw their

ſtabed <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> &amp; the Petition of Right &amp;c. to the very
heart and ſoule, &amp; did aſmuch as in him lyes, by that act deſtroy all
our Lawes and liberties, for if authority muſt be backt with the ſword, to
put in execution all their unjuſt commands, then farwell all law and liberty
forever, and accurſed be the day, that ever the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment raiſed an Army

acceptable every man may iudge, and for the merit of it <hi>I</hi> will not
call that in queſtion, for I am ſure no wiſe man can juſtifie it.</p>
                        <p>Now ſince <hi>I</hi> am certainly informed, that a

                        <p>This is ſo preiudiciall unto me, that <hi>I</hi> am
forced to end this Seſſion ſome few houres before I meant it, being
willing not to receive any more Remonſtrances, to which <hi>I</hi> muſt
give a harſh anſwer.</p>
                        <p>And ſince I ſee that even the Houſe of Commons
begins already to make falſe Conſtructions of what I granted in your

                        <p>The profeſſion of both Houſes, in the time of

they had neither intention nor power to hurt it.</p>
                        <p>Therefore it muſt needs be conceived, that <hi>I</hi>
have granted no new, but only confirmed the ancient Liberties of my ſubiects.
Yet to ſhew the cleareneſſe of my intentions, that <hi>I</hi> neither
repent, nor meane to recede from any thing I have promiſed you, I doe here
declare. That thoſe things which have been done, whereby men had ſome
cauſe to ſuſpect the Liberty of the ſubiects to be trench't upon

                        <p>To conclude, I command you all that are here, to take
notice of what I have ſpoken at this time, to be the true intent of what I
granted you in your petition: But eſpecially you, my Lords, the Iudges, for
to you only, under me, belongs the interpretation of Lawes: for none of the
Houſes of Parliament, joynt or ſeparate (what new doctrine ſoever may be

loſt his head upon the Tower Hill at London, in the yeare 1641. And that it
was his principall crime, appeares clearly to me by his Bill of Attainder,
which you may read before. pag. 29. and by the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>That he the ſaid Thomas Earl of Strafford, hath
traiterouſly endeavoured to ſubvert the fundamentall lawes and government
of the Realmes of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland, <hi>and in ſtead thereof
to introduce an Arbitrary and Tyrannicall Government againſt law, which he
hath declared by trayterous words, councells, and actions, and by giving His
Majeſtie advice by force of Armes, to compell his loyall Subiects to ſubmit
thereunto.</hi>

                        <p n="1">1. They aſſociated themſelves only as a
company of free Commons of <hi>England,</hi> to ſtand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the
juſt principles, and law of nature and nations, to recover their own and all
the peoples juſt rights and liberties. <hi>See the ſolemn Engagement upon

ſubſcribing hereunto, doe hereby declare, agree, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to and with
each other, that we ſhal not willingly disband, nor divide, nor ſuffer our

attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Compare the latter end of page the 4. with page 5. And upon
their march towards <hi>London,</hi> in proſecution of this deſign,
whereupon they aſſociated, the General declared in his letter to the City,
<hi>that they as Engliſh men inſiſted upon the ſettlement of the peace
of the Kingdome, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject, which they had right to
demand.</hi> See the letter from the Generall, and the Generall Officers at
<hi>Royſton</hi> upon <hi>Iune</hi> 10. page 2. 3. And in their further
opening of their meaning and intentions in their agreeing together, or
aſſociating as before, they declared upon <hi>Iune</hi> 14. <hi>That they
were not a mercenary Army, hired to ſerve the arbitrary power of a State, but
continued in armes in judgement and conſcience for the defence of their own
and the peoples luſt rights and liberties.</hi> Now the Army thus refuſing
to ſerve the Arbitrary power of the State and agreeing together as Engliſh
men, to ſtand upon Principles of Right and Freedome. From hence.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Its cleare, that the Officers and Soldiers kept
in a body, and ſo were an Army not by the wil of the State, but by their own
mutuall Agreement.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. From thence its as cleare, that they not being an
Army by the States will, they were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe rules of Martiall
Government, which were given by the will of the State to rule thoſe which
were a Military body or Army by their will and power.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From thence its alſo as cleare, as they
continuing an Army at that time, not by the States will, power or Command, but
their mutuall Agreement, they could be under no other government as an Army but
ſuch as they did conſtitute or appoint for themſelves by mutuall
agreement, and this leades to 22. Reaſon, proving the diſſolution of the
Armies government by Martiall Law.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The Soldiers with ſome Officers of the Army,
having by mutual agreement gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into, or at leaſt continued

            <p>The wordes of the Engagement, pag. 4. 5. are theſe. <hi>Wee doe
hereby declare, agree, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to and with each others that wee ſhall
not willingly disband, nor divide, nor ſuffer our ſelves 
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115109:28"/> to be disbanded or divided without ſatisfaction in
relation to our grievances and deſires heretofore preſented, and ſecurity
that we as private men or other the free born people of England, ſhall not
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſubject to the like oppreſſion and iniury as have been
attempted, and this ſatisfaction and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to be ſuch as ſhall be
agreed unto by a Councell to conſiſt of thoſe generall Officers of the
Army (who have concurred with the Army in the premiſes) with two
Commiſſion Officers, and two Soldiers to be choſen for each Regiment, who
have concurred and ſhall concurre with us in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and in this
agreement.</hi> Hereby a new Councell was conſtitutes contrary to all
Martiall Law, and Diſcipline, by whom only they ingaged to be ordeered in
their proſecution of the ends for which they aſſociated, and by
conſequence ſeeing they continued an Army by their own wils, and only to
proſecute thoſe ends of common right and freedome, this Engagement to be
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only by that new Councell in their proſecution of thoſe ends,
extends to a whole rule of them as an Army.</p>
            <p>Now that this Councell was wholly new, and in a way diverſe or
different from all Martiall Courts or Councels of Warre, that ever the Sun
beheld in a mercenary Army, and as different from the Councell by which this
Army was formerly governed appeares thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Members of this Councell by which they ingaged to be
ordered, are different wholly from the Members of all former Councells in the
Army.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The quallity of them is different, none but ſuch as
concurred in diſobeying the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the Principles of common
right and freedome, upon which they ſtood, were to be Members of this
Councell, neither the Generall, nor the Lievtenant Generall themſelves were
to be Members of this Councell unleſſe they had concurred in owning the
Regiments refuſall to disband, and in their ingagement or aſſociation,
and by conſequences they had been no Officers, as will appeare hereafter.</p>
            <p>In this all the Orders of Warre and Martiall Lawes were broken,
for if the Generall, Lievte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Generall, and Commiſſary Gen.
<hi>Ireton,</hi> had not concurred they could not all have caſhiered one
Officer that did concurre, all the Soldiers had beene Engaged to oppoſe them,
pay they could not have caſhiered one Soldier that joyned in the Engagement,
for they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed each to other, not to ſuffer themſelves to be divided
before the ends of their Engagements was accompliſhed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſtation of the Members of this new councel in this
Army was different from the ſtation of al M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mbers of former Councels, by the Engagement there
was to be two Soldiers in no office out of every Regiment to have voices equall
to the Generall himſelf in all votes, a thing never practiſed nor heard of
in an Army ſerving the will of a State.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The number of the Members of this Councel is different
from al cuſtomes and rules of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>In this Councel, there was to be but foure of every Regiment with
the General Officers which concurred, thus this Councel differed from all
Cuſtomes in any Army in reſpect of the Members whereof it was
conſtituted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This new Councell differed from the rules of Warre in the
manner of its conſtitution, this was not to be conſtituted by the Gens. wil
or according to the degrees or offices of men in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

way by the Soldiers free election, the Gen. is bound from calling an Officer to
the Councell unleſſe he be choſen by his Regiment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reaſon, proving the diſſolution of Martiall
Government in the Army.</p>
            <p>The Gen. in aſſociating with the Soldiers did in the very
Engagement, give away all his power of exerciſing Martial Diſciplin, <hi>he
engaged to them &amp; they to him, that they would not ſuffer themſelves to
be disbanded or devided, till the ends of their uniting were obtained.</hi>
Hereby he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted <pb n="44" facs="tcp:115109:29"/> himſelfe of his arbitrary power of
caſhiering Officers and Soldiers at his pleaſure, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiering one
Officer, or Soldier which aſſociated with the body of the Army in the
engagement, is a disbanding, at deviding on part of the Army from another,
which he &amp; the Army mutually

               </gap>ciprocally engaged,
neither to attempt nor ſuffer; likewiſe by this engagment he diveſted
himſelf of power to command the Soldiers to march to what diſtance he
pleaſeth one from an other, this is an other kinde of dividing the Army which
he enaged neither to effect, nor ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Reaſon, proving the diſſolution of the Government
of the Army, by Law Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall.</p>
            <p>The whole Army by agreement or joynt conſent caſhiered all
Officers at <hi>New maket Heath,</hi> that would not aſſociate with them,
and engage to ſtand for common right and freedom, though againſt the
Parliament, and ſo they houted divers Officers out of the field, unhorſed
ſome and rent their cloathes, and be at them: &amp; this in the face of the
Gen. al which acts weare death by Martiall Law; but this was an actuall
declaration that the Army did admit of Officers by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall agreement onely,
and therefore Government by law Martiall was diſſolved unleſſe it had
been eſtabliſhed by mutuall conſent throughout the Army, for Officers at
that time being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admitted by mutuall conſent they could have no power,
but what was betruſted to them by the Soldiers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Plea, But in caſe the Government of the Army by Law
Martiall had not been diſſolved by a mutuall ingagement, yet the very being
of peace did diſſolve its for in the Petition of<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Poultons</hi> col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſtatutes p. 1431.

adjudged by Law Martiall except in time of Warre and that all Commiſſions
given to execute Martiall Law, in time of peace are contrary to the Lawes and
Statutes of the Kingdome, and it was the Parliaments complaint that Martiall
Law, was then commanded to be executed upon Soldiers for robbery, mutiny, or
murther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it was ſetled as the undoubted right of every Engliſh man,
that he ſhould be puniſhable only in the Ordinary Courts of juſtice,
according to the Lawes and Statutes of the Kingdome By all this it appeares
that it is illegall and uniuſt for the Officers of the Army to try or
puniſh any Agent, or other by Law Martial, upon pretence of Muteny or any
other offence: the whole Army ſtand as Engliſhmen, and if they offend are
not exempted from the proceeding againſt them, and puniſhments to be
inflicted upon them, by the lawes, and ſtatutes of the Kingdome, and therfore
cannot in Iuſtice be ſubject alſo to law martiall, ſo that all Agents
and Soldiers now accuſed for mutiny, for their late proſecution of publick
freedome, according to the agreement of the people, without their Officers
content ſhall unworthily betray their owne and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys Liberty, if

deſtroy the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall liberties and principles of the common Law of

                           <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. Henry Martins anſwer to the

being a maxime in law and reaſon both, <hi>That all ſuch Acts and

                        </p>
                        <p>But for them to give you a power by Marſhal Law, or
under any other name or title whatever, by your arbitrary tyrannicall wills
without due courſe and proceſſe of Law, to take away the Life or Liberty
of me, or any free Commoner of <hi>England</hi> whatſoever, yea, or any of
your own Souldiers in time of peace, when the Courts of Iuſtice are all open,
and no viſible <pb n="50" facs="tcp:115109:32"/> declared enemie in Armes in the Kingdome
ready to deſtroy it, is an abſolute deſtroying of our fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall

<hi>England.</hi>
                           <note n="†" place="margin">But beſides all this I doe
confidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Parliament never gave power unto the Generall

ſome chiefe Executors of Martiall Law, have any Legall Commiſſion from
the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who never that I could heare of, ever gave power unto the
Generall of himſelf to make gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Officers: and beſides, all the

                        </p>
                        <p>And therfore ſuch a power of Arbitrary Marſhall Law,
cannot juſtly by the Parliament in time of peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be given
unto you, (nor if it were) be juſtly or warantably executed by you.</p>
                        <p>And beſides, both houſes themſelves by an Ordinance

                        <p>And therefore that which is not within their owne power to
do, they cannot by an Order or Ordinance grant power to Sir <hi>Thomas

Marſhall,</hi> who attempted to try me by Marſhall Law, for certaine
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended crimes, ſpecified in a paper by way of Articles, exhibited by a

Articles were ſigned by <hi>Henry Whaley</hi> who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Iudge

And after much debate by the ſaid Officers upon the ſaid Plea,

46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51.</note> upon the deep and weighty conſideration of all
which, J am compelled, out of the ſenſe of avoyding the being too juſtly
eſteemed by all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, rationall men, a traytor, and ſubverter
of the Lawes and liberties of <hi>England,</hi> to ſtand unto my ſaid Plea,
without any further anſwer then this.</p>
                        <p>That the government of the Army by <hi>Law
Marſhall,</hi> is only neceſſary when the Kingdome is invaded by a
forraign enemie, or in a generall hurly burly in it ſelf, being ready to
march againſt a declared profeſſed enemie ready to deſtroy it with fire
and Sword, and thereby ſhut up the legall adminiſtration of iuſtice upon
Tranſgreſſors and Offenders in the ordinary courſe thereof.</p>
                        <p>But now there is no forraigne enemie upon the march
againſt <hi>England,</hi> nor no generall Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Burly in the Kingdome by
profeſſed and declared enemies againſt the peace thereof ready to
deſtroy it with fire and ſword, but all at the preſent is viſibly in
peace and quietneſſe, <hi>and the Courts of iuſtice all open to puniſh
all manner of offenders whatſoever,</hi> (yea Souldiers in Armes that have
ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the States pay<note n="*" place="margin">For whom the Statute law in
ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, hath appointed puniſhments to be inflicted upon them in
the ordinary Courts of iuſtice, either for falſe muſters, cheating the
Soldiers of their pay, or for lucer giving them leave to depart, or for the
Souldiers going from their Cullours without lawfull leave, or for imbeaſing
Horſe or Armes, &amp;c. See the 18. H. 6. 19. and 2, and 3. Ed. 6. 2. and 4.
and 5. P. and M. chap. 3. and 5. Eliz. 5. and 5. Iames. 25.</note>) who only in
times of peace (as this is) are ſolely to be puniſhed by the rules and
proceedings of the known and declared law of <hi>England,</hi> and by no other
rules whatſoever.</p>
                        <p>And therefore it being now time of peace, there is no need
of Marſhall Law, neither can your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, nor any other under you upon
any pretence whatſoever, derived from any power whatever, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it upon
paine of being eſteemed and iuſtly iudged to be abſolute executers of an
Arbitrary and tyrannicall power, and grand deſtroyers of our Lawes and
liberties, and ſo in time may receive the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> doome,
one of whoſe principall crimes <hi>I</hi> underſtand was, That he in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> in time of peace (when he was Generall of an Army on foot)
ſhed the blood of Warre, by executing a Souldier by Marſhall Law, when the
Courts of iuſtice were open.</p>
                        <p>And therefore I doe abſolutely proteſt againſt the
name and power of your pretended Court Marſhall. And doe further declare,
that <hi>I</hi> iudge my ſelf bound in conſcience with all my might power,

                  <p>I Was condemned the 20. <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1647. by divers
Officers aſſembled together in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a Court Marſhall, for
ſpeaking before them my own Conſcience and judgement with ſoberneſſe,
about <hi>Maior Cobits</hi> buſineſſe. Now in juſtification of my
ſelf, I muſt declare unto your Excellencie, <hi>that in all Councells
whatſoever, the members thereof ought without check, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule,
moleſtation, or feare of ruine and deſtruction, freely to ſpeak and
declare the dictates of their iudgement and conſciences.</hi> And undoubtedly
the denyall thereof, would render all Councells whatſoever, uſeleſſe
and vaine. And its no leſſe then the hight of tyranny in any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
partie in a Councell to uſurp ſuch a power, as by terrors, cenſures, or
force, to ſtop the mouths of thoſe who are of different opinions, and
againſt whoſe arguments or ſaying they offer no reaſons.</p>
                  <p>And its no leſſe againſt law, and juſtice, yea, the
common light of nature, for the members of that Councell (who were the only
offended parties, to aſſume to themſelves to be proſecutors,
witneſſes, Iury and Judges, as they did in my caſe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>I</hi> am reſolved in the ſtrength of God,
never to betray my innocencie, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging an offence according as the
cenſures of my accuſers require, when my conſcience beares me
witneſſe, that as in the fight of God I did my duty, ſo I doe freely
declare, that <hi>I</hi> am ſtill clearely ſatisfied. That ſince our
aſſociation by mutuall Ingagement at <hi>New-Market</hi> to ſtand as free
Commons of <hi>England,</hi> for common right and freedome. And ſince our
conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new Councell to be our directer in the manner of
proſecuting thoſe publique ends of juſtice, right and freedome, there is
no aſſembly, but that new conſtituted Councell only which is a competent
Iudge of the Actions of any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in the Armie, and in his proſecution of
the ends aforeſaid. And of this nature <hi>I</hi> conceive was Maior
<hi>Cobits</hi> caſe.<note n="†" place="margin">Whom thoſe godly,
pious and righteous Gentlemen of the Councell of Warre tryed for his life, for
no other crime, but for his honeſty, in proſecuting that juſt paper

                  </p>
                  <p>And I muſt further declare, that I am not only willing, but
<hi>I</hi> account it my honour to be under your Excellencies conduct, ſo
long as you ſhall act according to the firſt principles manifeſted in the
Commiſſion (received from your Excellency, according to the publique
declaration of the Souldiery upon <hi>Triplo</hi> Heath, <hi>for Iuſtice,
Iuſtice.</hi> And according to the Solemn Ingagement, neither ſhall any man
be more obedient to your Excellencies commands, tending to thoſe ends, then
my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:115109:34"/>But <hi>I</hi> muſt declare, that
<hi>I</hi> clearely apprehend the higheſt injuſtice of executing Marſhal
Lawe in time of peace, thoſe lawes are appointed for caſes of neceſſity
and extremitie, when the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie is marching againſt an enemie, and its then
only juſtifiable, either becauſe other Courts of juſtice are not open, or
there cannot be a timely proſecution of offenders in thoſe Courts. But when
all other Courts of juſtice are open, and no enemie in the field to
obſtruct a free acceſſe to them, and when every Souldier is puniſhable
in thoſe Courts, and by the known lawes of the land for any crime or offence;
<hi>I</hi> conceive common juſtice dictates Marſhall Lawes to be null
otherwiſe two Courts not ſubordinate each to other, claiming the
iuriſdiction over a Souldier ſuppoſedly offending, when the Known Lawes
ſhall have acquitted him, he may ſuffer by the will of a Court Marſhall.
And therefore the Petition of Right complained of executing ſuch Marſhall
Lawes in time of peace. Which Petition being granted, it remaineth as a valid
Act of Parliament againſt it. And the Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> was
impeached of High Treaſon for procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt and condemning the Lord
Mount <hi>Norris</hi> by Marſhall Law,<note n="†" place="margin">See the

15. and 19. Article of that Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> though the ſentence was not
executed.</p>
                  <p>Upon all theſe conſiderations, <hi>I</hi> cannot but be
confident that the juſtice and conſcience which dwels in your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie,
will compell you to reſtraine the proceedings of that Aſſembly of
Officers againſt me, who are my accuſers. And <hi>I</hi> hope your

eyes, that you will not ſuffer my place to be taken from me, unleſſe my
declining from the ends for which I aſſociated with the Armie can be proved
againſt me, or elſe ſome crime which according to law and juſtice
merits ſuch a cenſure. And I am not yet conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my ſelf of the

furious, unjuſt, and illegall as they were, in which they led the Generall on
hoodwink as their ſtalking Horſe, to the pits brink of his own ruine and

precious blood, of extraordinary choice Engliſh men, and ſweet
Chriſtians, and to the viſible rooting up by the roots of the fundamentall

arbitrary, tyrannicall government of Marſhall Law: by the rules and juſtice

condemned to death all the free men of England, as thoſe Souldiers they did.

            <p>This letter of mine was delivered to the Generals own hands as I
have been informed by ſome that was by, but <hi>I</hi> have not received the
leaſt anſwer unto it, which makes me conclude, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> and
<hi>Ireton,</hi> and there under Creaturers are convict in their conſciences,
that there is not the leaſt ſhaddow or ground in the world, for them in
times of peace to execut <pb n="57" facs="tcp:115109:35"/> Marſhall Law, the full
knowledge of which, they would not willingly the Generall ſhould be
poſſeſſed with, as it is probable at ſuch a diſpute as before I
offer and am ready to performe, he might be, and ſo might be ſorry, for
that murder committed upon the Soldier, that was ſhot at <hi>Ware,</hi> for
which I am ſure <hi>Cromwell, Ireton, Paul Hobſon,</hi> yea and my Brother
<hi>Henry Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne</hi> (if he were one that had a hand in the cauſing of
him to be ſhot) as well as all others that had, may by the Law of England be
apprehended, indicted, and tryed as wilfull murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and I am ſure in the
eye of the Law of God or England, no plea can ſave their lives, in any one of
whoſe condition, (in the eye of the Law, to be tyed to live in England) that
had a hand in that mans willful murder I would not be for al the gold in
England and let me without contempt, give this advice to the two great
forementioned <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Army, (whoſe preſent power is bent to
ſuppreſſe our fundamental laws and liberties, and to build up, and
eſtabliſh the higheſt of Tyranny and protect Tyrants) to turne over a new
leafe and turne honeſt, if they have any graines thereof left with in them,
and bend not their parts and power, to plead for and protect the preſent
tyrannicall Houſe of Lords in their unjuſt uſurpations, and to deſtroy
me in my unjuſt impriſonment (which I know is only continued by their power
and meanes) for doing my duty to my ſelfe, country, and poſterity, to
oppoſe them therein, leaſt they neceſſitate and compell me for the

ſhall dare, in the hight of all there unlimited potency, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded
greatneſſe, to indict them both for murderers, at the Kings bench barre, or
elſewhere, and ſhall dare to indict the Iudges for perjury &amp;c. if they
ſhall dare to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey any command in England, that ſhall command them not to
doe iuſtice and right in that particular.</p>
            <p>And now O unworthy and diſhonourable <hi>Cromwell,</hi> (that I
averre and will juſtifie to thy face) that brought and drew me into my
firſt conteſt with the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and when thou
hadeſt ſerved thy ends of me, <hi>viz.</hi> to helpe to pull him downe from

barbarous, tyrannicall, arbitrary, and murdering dealing with me, and ſeeing
it is clearely diſcovered every day more then other, and obvious in my
appreheſion to every rational mans eye, that the deſigne of the preſent
ſeeming ſanctified ſwaying faction; (which who they principally are,
<hi>I</hi> have named before) is totally to ſubject the freemen of this
Kingdome to vaſſaledge and ſlavery, and ſubdue there fundamentall lawes
and liberties, by cruſhing in peeces (arbitrarily and tyrannically,) euery
cordial hearted and Noun-Subſtantive Engliſh man, that dare peepe out in
the leaſt to owne his freedomes and liberties, or ſtand for them, thereby
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating that they have learned their leſſon well, from that old
guided Fox the Lord <hi>Say,</hi> whoſe maxime it is (if he be not wronged)
that it is as dangerous to let the people know their liberties and freedomes,
as to let a ſtomackt Horſe know his ſtrength, and therefore it is, that
my Lord and the reſt of his new factionated Independents (who in my Judgement
are grown more tyrannicall already, then either the Epiſcopalls of old, or
the late ſwaying Presbyterians) have ſo many Beagles and Cur-dogg, not only
to ſharlar, but to bite the ſhins of every man they can find out, that dare
preſume to write, print, or publiſh any light or information to the people;
and if they hold on but a little longer as they have begun, it is to be feared
they will make it death, as the great Turke doth, for any man to keep a
printing preſſe. And ſeeing they have (in my eyes) laid aſide the
ſtudying the Goſpell of truth and peace, or practiſing any thing that is
commended by it, and are totally ſtudying and practiſing of
<hi>Machievell,</hi> and are cloſing and dabbing with the intereſt of the

publiſhed by the Parliaments own authority for good law, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expounding the Statute of breaking priſon made in the firſt E. 2. upon the
words, <hi>without cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. fo. 590. expreſly ſaith this act
ſpeaking of a cauſe, <hi>is to be intended of a lawfull cauſe;</hi> and
therefore falſe impriſonment is not within this act.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Impriſonment is a reſtraint of a mans liberty,
under the cuſtodie of another,</hi> by lawfull warrant in deed or in law,
lawfull warrants, when the offence appeareth by matter of record, or when it
doth not appeare by matter of Record.</p>
                           <p>By matter of Record, as when the party is taken upon an
Jndictment at the ſuit of the King, or upon an appeale, at the ſuit of the
party: when it doth not appeare by matter of Record, as when a felony is done,
and the offender by a lawfull <hi>Mitrimus</hi> is committed to the Gaole for
the ſame. But between theſe two caſes, there is a great diverſitie: for
in the firſt caſe, whether any felony were committed, or no, If the
offender be taken by force of a <hi>Capias,</hi> the warrant is lawfull, and if
he break priſon, it is felony, albeit no felony were committed. But in the
other caſe, if no felony be done at all, and yet he is committed to priſon
for a ſuppoſed Felony, and break priſon, this is no felony, for there is
no cauſe. And the words of this Act<note n="†" place="margin">See
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> Chap. 29.</note> are, <hi>unleſſe the cauſe for
which he was taken require ſuch a iudgment,</hi> ſo as the cauſe muſt
be juſt, and not feigned, for things feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned require no judgement.</p>
                           <p>If A. give B. a mortall wound, for which A. is committed
to Priſon, and breaketh priſon, B. dyeth of the wound within the yeare,
this death hath relation to the ſtroke, but becauſe relations are but
fictions in Law, and fictions are not here intended, this eſcape is no
felony, 11. H. 4, 11. Plowd. com. 408. <hi>Coler caſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Seeing the weight of this buſineſſe, touching this
point, to make the eſcape, either in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in the Gaolers felony,
dependeth upon the lawfulneſſe of the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> it will be

cauſe for which he was taken,</hi> &amp;c.) but not ſo certainly as an
Indictment ought, and yet with ſuch convenient certainty, as it may appeare
judicially, that the offence <hi>require ſuch a iudgement; as for high
treaſon, to wit, againſt the perſon of our Lord the King; or for the
counterfeiting of the money of our Lord the King; or for petty treaſon;
namely for the death of ſuch a one, being his maſter; or for felony, to
wit, for the death of ſuch a one,</hi> &amp;c. or for Burglary or

judicially, that the offence <hi>requires ſuch a judgement.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And this is proved both by reaſon, and authority. By
reaſon; firſt, for that it is in caſe of fellony, <hi>(which doth induce,
or draw on the laſt puniſhment)</hi> and therefore ought to have
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient certainty, as it is aforeſaid. Secondly, Alſo it muſt have
convenient certainty, for that a voluntary eſcape is felony in the Gaoler.
Thirdly, If the <hi>Mittimus</hi> ſhould be good generally, <hi>(for
felony)</hi> then, as the old rule is, <hi>(the ignorance of the Judge,
ſhould be the calamity of the innocent:)</hi> for the truth of the caſe may

concerning the life of man, the convenient certainty ought to be ſhewed.</p>
                           <p>By Authority, the conſtant forme of the Jndictment, in
that caſe foreſcape, either by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or voluntarily ſuffered by the
Gaoler, is, That he was arreſted <hi>for ſuſpition of a certaine
felony,</hi> namely, <hi>for the death of a certain man, M. N. feloniouſly

the Mittimus, which directly proveth, <hi>that the cauſe in ſuch a generall
certainty ought to be ſhewed,</hi> vid. 23. <hi>E.</hi> 3. fo. 48.</p>
                           <p>And if a man be indicted of treaſon, or indicted or
